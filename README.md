# Insights

From our analysis, 
we observed that Age and Population have been highly implicated as a risk factor in the infection and spread of the disease.
Furthermore, the South Western region seem to be affected the most which in part could be due to its population while the Northern parts appear to have less cases in comparison, perhaps due to under-reporting or insufficient awareness. 

# Future Work

In the coming days, I would like to explore how the recommendations implemented from this data has improved the prevention and control of the disease and also explore the effectiveness of the strategies currently being put in place such as vaccination, nose cover, social distancing etc. 

# Standout Section

Apart from the instructions in the starter notebook, I was able to:
- Use the pyplot to observe the regions that are most and least affected. 
- I was able to use drop column and manipulate the index to drop multi-line indexes.
